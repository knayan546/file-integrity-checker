Certainly! Below is a Python script that monitors changes in files by calculating and comparing hash values using the hashlib library. This script will compute the hash of a specified file and store it. It can then be run again to check if the file has changed by comparing the current hash with the stored hash.

How to Use the Script:
Set Up: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Save the Script: Copy the script into a file named file_monitor.py.
Modify the File Path: Change the file_to_monitor variable to the path of the file you want to monitor.
Run the Script: Open a terminal and run the script using the command:
python file_monitor.py

Monitor Changes: The script will print a message if it detects any changes to the specified file.
Explanation:
The calculate_file_hash function computes the SHA-256 hash of the file.
The monitor_file function checks the file's hash at regular intervals (default is 10 seconds) and compares it to the previous hash.
If a change is detected, it prints a message indicating that the file has changed.


Feel free to modify the script as needed for your specific use case!
